      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenovus_Energy" target="_blank" title="CVE_WIKI">Cenovus Energy Inc</a> (pronounced se-nō-vus) is an integrated oil and natural gas company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta.
      <br>Cenovus was formed in 2009 when Encana Corporation split into two distinct companies, with Cenovus becoming focused on oil sands assets.
      <br>In 2017, Cenovus purchased ConocoPhillips' 50 percent share of their Foster Creek Christina Lake (FCCL) oil sands projects and most of their conventional assets in Alberta and British Columbia, including the Deep Basin.
      <br>Cenovus completed the acquisition of Husky Energy for C$3.9 billion in stock in January 2021.
      <br>The combined company is Canada’s third-largest crude oil and natural gas producer and the second-largest Canadian-based refiner and upgrader.
      <br>Cenovus is headquartered in Calgary's Brookfield Place, having completed a move from the neighbouring Bow in 2019.
